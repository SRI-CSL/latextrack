Usage

  LTC consists of a base system running under Java and the LaTeX editor specific user interface.  We provide a Java
  application called LTC Editor that contains the base system as well as a simple text editor as the user interface.
  The main usage, although, is to run the base system as a server and have an editor-specific LTC implementation
  connect to the base system via XML-RPC on the localhost.  Our first editor-specific implementation is the Emacs
  <<<ltc-mode>>>, which is a minor mode to the <<<latex-mode>>>.

  Future implementations for popular LaTeX editors such as TeXShop and TeXWorks are planned or could be contributed by
  the community using the API of the base system.

Quick Start

  To run the base system, execute the downloaded JAR file in a terminal (if you want to see logging output).  If you
  launch the JAR using a double-click under Mac OS X, for example, you would need to set the environment variable
  <<<GIT_BIN_DIR>>> in <<<~/.MacOSX/environment.plist>>> to point to the directory containing the git executable.
