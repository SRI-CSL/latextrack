\chapter{Using LTC}

The intended use of LTC is running the base system as a server and have a plugin of the user's preferred LaTeX editor connect to it.  The provided Emacs \Code{ltc-mode} is an example of such a plugin and its use is described in Section~\ref{sec:emacs}.  We hope to add more plugins for other popular LaTeX editors in the future.

As a minimum implementation of a user interface to LTC, we also provide a Java application ``LTC Editor'' that uses the base system API but does not rely on running a separate LTC server.  Its use is explained in Section~\ref{sec:java}.

Before we address using these specific user interfaces, we discuss how to setup your repository for a LaTeX writing project with git (Section~\ref{sec:git-use}) or svn (Section~\ref{sec:svn-use}) and then the general usage of LTC in Section~\ref{sec:general-use}.
