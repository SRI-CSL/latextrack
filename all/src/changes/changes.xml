        <release version="1.0.4" date="2014-01-27">
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="fix" issue="46">
                Fixed semantics of limiting by authors to not attribute changes to others.
            </action>
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="add">
                Newly implemented text field for limiting authors in LTC Editor that allows drag-n-drop as well as
                automatically completes known author names.
            </action>
        </release>

        <release version="1.0.3" date="2013-12-18">
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="add">
                Improved error message handling for SVN authentication issues.  Added a FAQ item, which is also shown
                when error occurs in LTC Editor or ltc-mode.
            </action>
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="add">
                Redesigned LTC Editor to have a more compact view on LTC information (strongly influenced by Emacs'
                info buffer).  Still a few issues open here (continue to develop on feature branch).
            </action>
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="fix" issue="42">
                Allowing limiting by latest version on disk or in editor, which results in empty changes but might be
                nice to temporarily see the document without changes.
            </action>
        </release>

        <release version="1.0.2" date="2013-11-19">
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="add" due-to="Peter">
                New Emacs function to undo-change at point or all changes by the same author or in region.  (Needs to
                be documented soon.)
            </action>
            <action dev="jim_klo" type="add" due-to="Peter">
                The coloring of the revision history is now more intuitive -- the first version with changes is now
                shown as the first active/colored one instead of the base version with which to compare.
            </action>
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="fix" issue="17">
                Better control of debug and log output in Emacs.  Now there is a customizable toggle in the "ltc" group
                that governs the amount of output in *Messages*.  The contents of the *Messages* buffer is also copied
                into the bug report.
            </action>
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="fix" issue="44">
                Fixed issue that prevented SVN-controlled files in subdirectories to work.
            </action>
        </release>

        <release version="1.0.1" date="2013-09-27">
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="add" issue="4">
                A new setting whether to allow similar colors for authors guides the color selection upon an LTC update.
            </action>
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="update">
                Thanks to various beta-testers we fixed a number of small bugs such as: (1) logging from XML-RPC was
                using a hardcoded path, which did not exist for most users, resulting in an exception thrown from the
                LTC server and confusing users, (2) making it easier to email bug reports, (3) adding a date to all tool
                tips when hovering over a marked up change so that it is easier to match it to the list of changes, (4)
                fixed bug when author name and email was too long to be stored in Java Preferences, and (5) handling
                MS-DOS encoded newlines in Emacs mode.
            </action>
        </release>

        <release version="1.0" date="2013-08-19">
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="fix" issue="38">
                Fixed problem with limiting by revision under svn in Emacs.
            </action>
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="fix" issue="33">
                Allowing git files with merge conflicts to be included in history.
            </action>
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="fix" issue="34">
                Removing commit, pull and push from LTC Editor and Emacs ltc-mode and making the API leaner by removing
                calls that interact with version control system.  Instead, users should use the regular tools for
                their VCS such as the command line.  Adjusted tutorial sections in manual accordingly.
            </action>
        </release>

        <release version="0.9.15" date="2013-05-03">
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="fix" issue="27">
                When specifying limit dates that are not exactly a commit date, one commit too many was included in the
                active list.  This is now fixed and affected both, Emacs and LTC Editor.
            </action>
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="fix" issue="28">
                The text field to define a start date in LTC Editor now accepts text that is dragged-and-dropped or
                pasted into the field.
            </action>
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="fix" issue="30">
                Emacs mode now displays a graph instead of a line for the history of the file.  This makes much more
                sense to the user.
            </action>
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="fix" issue="31">
                Emacs remembers height and location in the info buffer between updates.  The lines are also truncated
                for a better use of screen real estate (not if vertically split, though).  The user has to manually
                scroll in that buffer to be able to view the truncated lines.
            </action>
        </release>

        <release version="0.9.14" date="2013-04-10">
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="fix">
                Now parsing non-ASCII characters during lexical analysis.
            </action>
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="fix" issue="21">
                Now parsing natural language constructs for limiting the version control history to a start date.
            </action>
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="update">
                Improved LTC Editor to disable certain GUI controls when presented with an SVN-controlled .tex file,
                as setting "Self" and "Remotes" make no sense in that context.
            </action>
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="add" issue="22">
                Added a boolean setting (persistent) whether to condense authors or not.  By default, this is off so
                we see all intermediate versions of the same author marked up.  The mark up changes once we turn this
                setting on, resulting in skipping intermediate versions (as done in the original implementation).
            </action>
        </release>

        <release version="0.9.13" date="2013-03-19">
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="fix" issue="3">
                LTC Editor now has a button (with shortcut CMD/CTRL-R) to open a dialog to create a bug report.
            </action>
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="fix">
                Install script does not rely on JDK anymore ('jar' tool) to unzip Emacs lisp files.  The documentation
                has been adjusted.
            </action>
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="fix" issue="6">
                About dialog now contains version information but license is only available via command line.  All other
                command line tools have been adjusted to provide a mode of displaying the license.  Small improvements
                to applications under Mac OS X.  When we move to improved deployment (Ubuntu and Mac OS X), we can address
                these things more -- until then issue has been labeled as 'wont-fix'.
            </action>
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="fix" issue="8" due-to="Peter">
                Fixing markup of replacement sentences -- instead of marking up alternating words as replacements, the
                longest subsequence of words is consecutively marked up.
            </action>
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="fix" issue="20">
                Adding revision ID to change markup so that LTC Editor and Emacs mode now display the revision ID with
                each change when the user hovers over a marked up character.
            </action>
        </release>

        <release version="0.9.12" date="2013-01-30">
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="fix" issue="7" due-to="Tomer">
                LTC Server and Editor now runs under Linux again.
            </action>
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="update">
                Emacs mode updates "modified" and "on disk" flags in history as soon as edit and save operations
                happen; revisions and dates are now click-able in history buffer of Emacs mode to use these for
                limiting history; improved menu labels and prompts for user; install script now includes hint how to
                reload the Emacs mode file if Emacs was running while updating
            </action>
            <action dev="lilalinda" due-to="Peter" type="update">
                Better text for home page and link to Peter's web site.
            </action>
            <action dev="lilalinda" due-to="Cher" issue="5" type="update">

            <action dev="lilalinda" type="add">
                Adding build information to About dialog, JAR manifest, and bug report.
            </action>
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="update">
                Bug report generation now obeys parameter whether to include the source repository.
            </action>
            <action dev="lilalinda" type="update">
                Emacs mode asks user now whether to include the source repository in bug report;
                it also provides a new command to set an author color without using a mouse-click.
            </action>
        </release>

        <release version="0.9.10" date="2012-12-18" description="first beta-release at sourceforge">
